## Iâ€™m Francios Botes.  
###Traveling the world ministering through Prophetic Music Ministry.

Francois Botes got saved in 1980 in South Africa. He was studying classical Piano and Singing at the time.

Very soon his prophetic calling was evident, and after serving a number of years on the worship team of a local church , he started full-time ministry in 1988.

Today he is based in the United Kingdom and ministers worldwide in local churches and oversees a number of Prophetic training seminars / schools both for those who are generally interested in the Worship and Prophetic ministry, and for those who are clearly called to the 5 fold ministry of Prophet.

Of all the 5 fold ministries we only find training centres in the Scripture for the Prophet......maybe because it is the most misunderstood , most difficult to mature in of all the ministries.

Francois would like to play a role in the maturing process of those called to 5 fold ministry of Prophet.....especially to those in local churches.
